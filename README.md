# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of our project is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to to participate in the mentorship program. Where we were tasked with producing these deliverables:
 - Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
 - Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
 - Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis
 
 ## Resources:
 Using SQL- relational databases
 
 ## Results
 -  With the retirment_titles table we are able to see every eligible for retirement employee and how long they have  - worked at each position over the course of their career.

  - The final part of our project shows mentorship eligibility, if you look at the head of the new csv - you can see that most of these employees have senior titles.

 ## Summary
We can see that 63 % of the workforce is either retirment or mentorship eligible there will most likely be many positions to fill over the next 5-10 years. There may not exactly be enough people in the workforce to take care of the tasks or even come close to the amount of experience to fill these roles so quickly. What companies can do is try to best learn about what these employees did to be so successful having such long lasting careers to continue the tradition for future employees. Most likely the future generation is more computer savy/ efficent due to technologies and can catch on quickly helping companies continue to trend in the right direction by keeping revenues up.
